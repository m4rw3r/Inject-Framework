The Boot Process

<p>
	A walkthrough through the boot process of the Inject Framework explains a lot
	about how the Inject Framework is functioning and how the different components
	are initialized.
</p>

<h2>Step 1: The Front Controller</h2>

<p>
	The Front Controller is a PHP file which initially will receive the request.
	It will load the Inject class file, call <dfn>Inject::init()</dfn>, configure it,
	create a request object and eventually call <dfn>Inject::run()</dfn>.
</p>

<code>
// load Inject Framework
require './Inject/inject.php';

// initialize the autolader and error handlers
Inject::init();

// configure
Inject::set_config_file('./config.php');
Inject::set_config('inject.front_controller', basename(__FILE__));

// create request object and run
Inject::run(new Inject_Request_HTTP);
</code>

<h3>(Step 2: The Inject::init() method)</h3>

<p>
	The <dfn>Inject::init()</dfn> method is not modifiable by the user
	in any way, and it does the following:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Registers an autoloader</li>
	<li>Registers error and exception handlers</li>
	<li>Starts output buffering</li>
</ul>

<h3>(Step 3: The Inject::run() method)</h3>

<p>
	The <dfn>Inject::run()</dfn> method is not modifiable by a user component
	and will handle the output buffering, the creation of the dispatcher and
	finally it will destroy the request, after the controllers have finished.
</p>

<h2>Step 4: The dispatcher</h2>

<p>
	The Dispatcher is a user replaceable class whose task is the following:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Get the controller class name from the request object, the dispatcher raises 404 if needed</li>
	<li>Get the action from the request object, the dispatcher sets the default</li>
	<li>Instantiate the controller object</li>
	<li>Call the action</li>
</ol>

<h2>Step 5: The Controller constructor</h2>

<p>
	The controller constructor receives the request object which will contain
	parameters and information about the request, it is usually assigned to the
	property $request.<br />
	After that, the user can do almost whatever he likes.
</p>

<h2>Step 6: The Controller Action</h2>

<p>
	The action has even less constraints.
</p>

<h2>Step 7: The output handler</h2>

<p>
	Lastly, the <dfn>Inject::parse_output()</dfn> is called.
	It has hooks for user functions/methods to apply parsing and / or
	compression before the output is sent to the browser.
