Inject Framework
================

A PHP framework which is based on the concept of Dependency Injection.

Requirements
------------

* PHP 5.2 (PHP Unit 4.0 requires PHP 5.3)
* PHPUnit 4.0 (optional, for unit tests)

Installation
------------

1. Copy the Inject folder to wherever you want, but preferably somewhere where you can
   include it from the bootstrap file.
2. Create a bootstrap file and place it somewhere you can run it (preferably
   with a web-server as Inject Framework is currently only aimed to be a web-framework).
3. Create a configuration file, in which you return an array containing all the
   configuration options you prefer to have (all settings have a default value,
   so you do not have to include this step).
4. Create an application directory which the configuration file points to
   (by default this is './application').
5. Start using Inject Framework.

Running Tests
-------------

1. Make sure that the tests directory is placed in the same directory as
   the Inject folder.
2. Run the tests by calling "PHPUnit tests" in that directory
